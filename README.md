"# FizzBuzz" 

FizzBuzz is a classic programming game used to teach programming logic and test basic developer skills. The main idea is to print numbers from 1 to 100 with a twist: For numbers divisible by 3, print "FIZZ." For numbers divisible by 5, print "BUZZ." For numbers divisible by both, print "FIZZBUZZ." If it doesn't meet any of these conditions, print the number itself.
